# Speaking and Conferences
I'm passionate about sharing information and learning from others as well as through my own experiences. 

Conferences are always a great way to be one with your tribe or seek new tribal connections. Not only that but being invited to take part in industry conferences as a speaker is a huge privilege. Panel and community events are also a great way to support the local and international community. 

I am open to approaches for speaker engagements at events both locally and internationally.
