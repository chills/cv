## Hi, my name is Cath!
I'm a designer and researcher, educator, writer, practice and people lead.  Some people, including Octocats and Slackers, call me Chills. 

> [No designer is an island, nor are their team members. It is possible for non-designers to design. It is also possible for designers to design alone or in isolation. Truly effective design, as an act, is mostly effectively undertaken if done collaboratively, with teams and users.](https://twitter.com/daughterofbev/status/1086508705288310786)
